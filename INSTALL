To build:

 A. Audience

      This document refers to the building of the software directly
      from source code.  This is distinct from building from the distribution
      tarball as the code has not been configured by Autotools at
      this stage.


  B. Dependency Overview

      You'll need the following build tools to compile XMLp:

      * autoconf 2.69 or later
      * automake 1.15 or later
      * libtool 2.4.6 or later
      * a reasonable C compiler (xlc, gcc, Visual Studio, etc.)


  C. Building
      You'll need to create the Autotools configuration as these files
      are not saved with the source:

        $ autoreconf --install

      It is then possible to run "./configure". You will need to specify
      a valid ORACLE_HOME and the path to an E-Business environment file:

        $ ./configure \
            -with-oracle-home=/opt/oracle/product/12.2.0/dbhome 

      Having done this you can create the tarball for RPM:

        $ make dist-gzip

      And move it to the SOURCES directory

        $ mv dbatools-<m>.<n>.tar.gz <_topdir>/SOURCES

      Copy the spec file:

        $ cp data/dbatools-<m>.<n>-<v>.spec <_topdir>/SPECS

      And edit it for local requirements, specifically the

            -with-oracle-home=

      arguments to "./configure" mentioned previously.

      You can then build the package:

        $ rpmbuild -bb <_topdir>/SPECS/xmlp-<m>.<n>-<v>.spec
